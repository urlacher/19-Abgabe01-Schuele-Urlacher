# 19-Abgabe01-Schuelle-Urlacher
## Topic
  Project to get in contact with the Versioning System Git in combination with https://github.com/.
  The focus lay on the two Java files 
  - Calculator.java (Interface)
  - Main.java
  
## Functionality
  The Calculator.java Interface delcare 3 Methods
  - int getMaximum()
  - int getMinimun();
  - void addValue();
  
  
## ToDo
- [x] copy content of this git repository (https://github.com/michaelulm/software-configuration-management) / zip file
- [x] create your own remote repository, take care about Project Layout (!)

  ### ToDo Thomas
  - [x] create Main Class with 'public static void main(String[] args)'
  - [x] create empty getMinimum()
  - [x] create empty getMaximum()
  - [x] create addValue() which add an Integer to a list for later usage in getMinimum(), getMaximum() and other Methods
  - [x] *publish current skeleton for your colleague(s) in remote repository*
  - [x] implement getMinimum() which returns lowest Integer
  - [x] test your method in main()
  - [x] *publish current implementation for your colleague(s) in remote repository*

  ### ToDo Denis
  - [x] implement getMaximum() which returns highest Integer
  - [x] test your method in main()
  - [x] *publish current implementation for your colleague(s) in remote repository*

  ### ToDo Thomas and Denis
  - [x] implement a sum() which returns the sum of all Integer Values added by add()
  - [x] implement this method with different implementations
  - [x] commit your changes
  - [x] if every Student has finished with commit, start to push your implementation
  - [x] if every implementation has been pushed to remote, tag final implementation with "FinalVersion"

  ## Final Assignment
  - don't forget to push everything (!)  
  - finish your assignment at elearning website with publishing repository url

  ### AND final version includes
  - runnable source code
  - with test call methods in main Class
  - before commit take care that you previously tested your own source code
