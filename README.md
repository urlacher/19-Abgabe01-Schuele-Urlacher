- [x] create your own remote repository, take care about Project Layout (!)
### ToDo Student 1
- [x] create Main Class with 'public static void main(String[] args)'

- [ ] create empty getMaximum()
- [ ] create addValue() which add an Integer to a list for later usage in getMinimum(), getMaximum() and other Methods
- [ ] *publish current skeleton for your colleague(s) in remote repository*
- [ ] implement getMinimum() which returns lowest Integer
- [ ] test your method in main()
- [ ] *publish current implementation for your colleague(s) in remote repository*

### ToDo Student 2
- [ ] implement getMaximum() which returns highest Integer
- [ ] test your method in main()
- [ ] *publish current implementation for your colleague(s) in remote repository*

### ToDo all Students
- [ ] implement a sum() which returns the sum of all Integer Values added by add()
- [ ] implement this method with different implementations
- [ ] commit your changes
- [ ] if every Student has finished with commit, start to push your implementation
- [ ] if every implementation has been pushed to remote, tag final implementation with "FinalVersion"

## Final Assignment
    - don't forget to push everything (!)  
    - finish your assignment at elearning website with publishing repository url

### AND final version includes
    - runnable source code
    - with test call methods in main Class
    - before commit take care that you previously tested your own source code
